              Our intention is to develop a health education and promotion program for undergraduate students enrolled at UPEI. This model of healthcare programming will provide education on topics that contribute to the health and wellbeing of the student population, along with an exercise program. The educational curriculum is based on a process-oriented approach known as a participatory planning process (Reger, Williams & Kolar, 2002). This process helps participants identify their problems, set goals, mobilize resources, and develop strategies for achieving their goals. (Reger et al, 2002).

              You have been invited to participate in this research project because you fit the eligibility criteria for the study.  This means that you are currently a University of Prince Edward Island undergraduate student, lasting the duration of the study.<br>
Individuals that are interested in participating in the Connections program will be invited to attend an information session to be held both virtually and in-person at UPEI. Health Centered Research Clinic staff will explain the program and the various activities in which participants will be involved, along with expected time commitments. Interested participants will be required to read through the background information form and sign the consent form once completed the participant will be asked to do the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) as part of the program screening procedure to determine if the participant is medically eligible to participate without the need of medical clearance. If the participant requires medical clearance they will be asked to do so, prior to intake of the program. If interested to continue in the Connections program, individuals may schedule a visit to the Health Centered Research Clinic whereupon they will complete a series of intake assessment forms. The intake forms will be administered by a Health Educator and Dietitian before the participant begins the program. After the participants will take part in a series of physical assessments administered by a kinesiologist that include measures of height, weight, resting heart rate, blood pressure, back scratch test, grip strength and plank test.

              <p>
              If you choose to participate in this research project you will first be asked to sign the letter of informed consent. Once the consent has been signed the next form you will need to fill out is the PAR-Q form which assesses your physical readiness. If the PAR-Q provides us with a score that shows that you are unable to participate in the physical component you will be asked to receive clearance from a healthcare professional before we can proceed with the next component of the study. Once the consent form and PAR-Q have been cleared. You will also be asked to complete an initial intake day.  The initial intake day will be held during the day and will be scheduled for 1.5 hours.  At this time, you will complete a series of non-invasive physical tests.  The physical tests will include: balance testing, one mile walk, half kneeling ankle flexion, back stratch test, resting heart rate, height/weight measurement and endurance of extensors. In addition to the physical tests, you will be asked to complete a number of surveys.  If you run out of time completing the surveys and questionnaires, you may take them with you and return the completed copies at your first session. Multiple surveys will be provided and they will be asking questions about: perceived stress, loneliness, willingness to change, physical activity readiness questionnaire, confidence questionnaire where questions of sensitive nature are asked; “How confident are you regarding practicing safe guidelines for consuming alcohol?” “How confident are you regarding your knowledge when it comes to practicing safe sex?”. All testing and sessions will take place at the Health Centred Research Clinic, located in the lower level of the Steel Building on the UPEI campus.
              <br>Once you have completed your initial intake day, you may attend your first session.  Your first session will be either an education or exercise session, depending on what group you have been allocated to.  Both groups will receive all of the education and exercise sessions.  At the education sessions, you will meet with the Health Centred Research Clinic’s Health Educator.  She will discuss various topics related to health, well-being and skills development. At the exercise sessions, you will meet with the Health Centred Research Clinic’s Kinesiologist.  He will demonstrate and work with you to complete a guided group exercise session.  He will also provide you with a tailored-to-you exercise routine to complete at home. All sessions will be 45 minutes in length, and will be held during various times of the day. You will be asked to complete activities and participate in group discussions throughout the education and exercise sessions. These sessions will be held once a week for 8 weeks.  This means you will be offered 8 education sessions and 8 exercise sessions.
	<br>Upon completion of the program, you will be asked to come to the Health Centred Research Clinic to complete all of the tests from the initial intake day.<br>
	You may also be asked to attend a focus group meeting to give feedback on your thoughts about the program, strengths of the program and areas of improvement.  These focus groups will give the research team a better understanding of areas of the program that should be changed or kept the same, should they continue the delivery of the program to different groups of people in the future.
	<br>If you choose to participate in the research study, your total time commitment will be the following:
<br>Initial intake day: 1.5 hours
<br>8 Education sessions: 8 sessions x 1 hour= 8 hours
<br>Post program assessment: 1.5 hours
<br>Total time commitment for participation in the research study: up to 19 hours

              There are no known risks for participating in this research study.
              <br>It is possible that you may feel some exercise related discomfort. There may be risks associated with participating in an exercise program, a kinesiologist is present to alleviate those risks.   In addition to this, you may feel uncomfortable answering some of the questions asked on the surveys and questionnaires, or during the education sessions.  However, if you feel uncomfortable about anything being discussed or asked of you, you may choose not to participate in that activity, or withdraw from the study completely.
