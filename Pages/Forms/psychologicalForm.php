      <div class="alert-info">
      <p>A more precise measure of personal stress can be determined by using a variety of instruments that have been
         designed to help measure individual stress levels. The first of these is called the <b>Perceived Stress
            Scale</b>.</p>
      <p>The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a classic stress assessment instrument. The tool, while originally
         developed in 1983, remains a popular choice for helping us understand how different situations affect our
         feelings and our perceived stress. The questions in this scale ask about your feelings and thoughts during the
         last month. In each case, you will be asked to indicate how often you felt or thought a certain way. Although
         some of the questions are similar, there are differences between them and you should treat each one as a
         separate question. The best approach is to answer fairly quickly. That is, donâ€™t try to count up the number of
         times you felt a particular way; rather indicate the alternative that seems like a reasonable estimate.</p>
